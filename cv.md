## About myself ## 

I'm looking for a Junior FrontEnd developer position in a company which can provide me wit opportunities for tech and soft skills development.

I'm graduated from the Minsk State Linguistic University, Interpreter's Department with knowledge of two foreign languages the English and Dutch. I have also completed Web Development course in the ITAcademy, Minsk and remote WG Forge course lead by Wargaming.net company. I'm looking forward to learn more.

I would love to become a part of a team, study new technology and their subtility, work with high-skilled professionals, learn from them and become a good specialist. And I do have strong desire to work :)

As far as I am a newcomer in the IT field I cannot brag about commercial development experience or rich portfolio. So far Premium Shop is the best project which I have created with my team and I'm proud of our team working and its result. Here is the link for your convenience:

Iâ€™m easy-going non-confrontational responsible person who is not afraid of taking charge and always ready to study hard. In my opinion, constant development necessity is one of the main advantage of
the FrondEnd development.
